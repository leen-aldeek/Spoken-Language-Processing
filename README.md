# Spoken Language Processing – Assignment 1

## Overview
This project is part of the Spoken Language Processing course (Fall 2025–2026) at Birzeit University. It involves:
- **Part A**: Acoustic analysis of vowels (F1, F2, duration)
- **Part B**: Pitch (F₀) analysis using Praat and Python
- **Part C**: Speech synthesis using the Source–Filter model

## Project Structure
- `report/`: Contains the final report (PDF)
- `data/`: Contains recordings and measurement files
- `code/`: Python scripts for analysis and synthesis
- `figures/`: Generated plots and spectrograms

## Tools Used
- **Praat** – For formant and pitch extraction
- **Python** – For automation and synthesis (librosa, parselmouth, scipy, matplotlib)
- **Excel** – For data organization
